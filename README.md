# Crowdfunding_ETL_
Project 2 Crowdfunding_ETL_
Nebiat Beyene & Stephanie Ayala
For this Project we were asked to extract, transform and load new data from the resources provided that included a jupyter notebook and two excel files to create four new csv files.
We used pandas, numpy, datetime, json in our code by using the "import" function. We also used Postgres to create the SQL tables as well as http://quickdatabasediagrams.com/ to create an ERD chart.
We saved queries for all four tables created including data types, primary keys and constraints in the schema.sql file. There are a total of four. Select queries are saved under select.sql
The ERD chart is saved as an image named ERD. This shows the relation between all four tables.
For this project we used xpert, chatgpt, google and past class activities to get help on codes, queries and technical questions.

and the original repo was deleted so you are in clear to rename it
